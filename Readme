A. Implementation Instructions
  1.Key Metrics:
Calculate Daily Volatility (short-term fluctuations).
Calculate Standard Deviation of returns (overall risk).
Compute Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, and Beta for investment risk assessment.
 2. Statistical Analysis:
Perform Correlation Analysis to assess diversification potential.
Evaluate VaR for downside risk.
Analyze the Skewness and Kurtosis of returns for abnormal behavior.
Report:
Highlight key insights such as:
Most volatile cryptocurrency.
Risk-adjusted performance (highest Sharpe Ratio).
Correlation trends and diversification opportunities.
Visualize these metrics using histograms, time-series plots, and scatter plots.

3. Financial Modeling:
Value at Risk (VaR)
Definition: Estimates the potential loss in value of an asset over a defined period at a given confidence level.
Why It’s Useful: Helps investors understand potential downside risk.
Common Confidence Levels: 95%, 99%.
Calculation:
Use historical returns to calculate the percentile of losses.
Sortino Ratio
Definition: A variant of the Sharpe Ratio that only considers downside risk.
Why It’s Useful: Penalizes only negative volatility, focusing on returns below a target level.
Formula: Sortino Ratio=Average Return - Target ReturnDownside Deviation\text{Sortino Ratio} = \frac{\text{Average Return - Target Return}}{\text{Downside Deviation}}Sortino Ratio=Downside DeviationAverage Return - Target Return​
Skewness and Kurtosis
Definition:
Skewness: Measures the asymmetry of the return distribution.
Kurtosis: Measures the "tailedness" of the return distribution.
Why It’s Useful: Helps in understanding if the asset has extreme returns (fat tails) or is skewed positively/negatively.

4. Additional Metrics

 A/B testing
